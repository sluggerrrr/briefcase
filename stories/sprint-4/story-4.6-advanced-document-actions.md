# Story 4.6: Advanced Document Actions Interface

**Epic:** User Interface & Document Management Dashboard
**Story Points:** 8
**Priority:** Should Have (P2)
**Sprint:** 4

## User Story
**As a** document owner or authorized user,  
**I want** advanced document management actions like bulk operations, search, and detailed analytics,  
**so that** I can efficiently manage multiple documents and gain insights into document usage patterns.

## Description
Implement advanced document management features including bulk operations (delete, share, download), document search, analytics dashboards, and enhanced document actions that leverage the existing backend APIs for power users and administrators.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Bulk Operations
1. ⏳ Multi-select functionality for document lists with checkboxes
2. ⏳ Bulk delete operation with confirmation dialog and progress tracking
3. ⏳ Bulk sharing with recipient selection and permission settings
4. ⏳ Bulk download as ZIP archive with progress indicator
5. ⏳ Select all/none functionality with smart selection indicators

### Document Search & Filtering
6. ⏳ Advanced search interface with text query, date ranges, and filters
7. ⏳ Filter by document type, status, owner, and recipient
8. ⏳ Real-time search results with debounced API calls
9. ⏳ Search result highlighting and relevance scoring
10. ⏳ Saved search functionality for frequent queries

### Document Analytics
11. ⏳ Individual document analytics page with view/download statistics
12. ⏳ Usage charts showing access patterns over time
13. ⏳ Recipient engagement metrics and access history
14. ⏳ Document health indicators (expiring, unused, frequently accessed)

### Enhanced Actions
15. ✅ Document sharing with recipient selection UI (API integration pending)
16. ⏳ Document expiration management and renewal
17. ⏳ Document versioning and revision history
18. ✅ Quick actions menu with contextual options (share button added to document cards)

## Technical Requirements
- Integrate with existing enhanced documents API endpoints
- Use TanStack Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Implement optimistic updates for better user experience  
- Progressive loading for large result sets
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates (future)

## Backend API Integration

### Bulk Operations
```typescript
// Bulk delete
POST /api/v1/documents/bulk/delete
{ document_ids: string[], confirm: boolean }

// Bulk share  
POST /api/v1/documents/bulk/share
{ document_ids: string[], recipients: string[], permissions: object }

// Bulk download
POST /api/v1/documents/bulk/download
{ document_ids: string[] } -> ZIP stream
```

### Search & Analytics
```typescript
// Enhanced search
GET /api/v1/documents/search?query={text}&type={mime}&owner={id}&recipient={id}&status={status}&from={date}&to={date}

// Document analytics
GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/analytics
GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/status/history
```

├── useDocumentSearch.ts       # Search state management
└── useDocumentAnalytics.ts    # Analytics data fetching
```

## UI/UX Design Requirements

### Bulk Operations
- **Multi-select**: Checkboxes with visual feedback and selection count
- **Action Bar**: Context-sensitive bulk action toolbar
- **Progress**: Real-time progress for bulk operations
- **Confirmation**: Clear confirmation dialogs with impact preview

### Search Interface
- **Advanced Form**: Collapsible advanced search with filters
- **Live Results**: Instant search with result preview
- **Filter Pills**: Visual filter indicators with remove option
- **Result Layout**: Grid/list view toggle with sorting options

### Analytics Dashboard
- **Charts**: Interactive charts for usage patterns (Chart.js/Recharts)
- **Metrics Cards**: Key metrics with trend indicators
- **Date Ranges**: Flexible date range selection
- **Export Options**: Export analytics data as CSV/PDF

## Permission Requirements
- Bulk operations require appropriate permissions on all selected documents
- Search respects user's document access permissions
- Analytics only available for documents user owns or has admin access to
- Permission checks performed before showing action options

## Performance Considerations
- Debounced search to reduce API calls (300ms delay)
- Pagination for large search results (25 items per page)
- Virtual scrolling for very large document lists
- Lazy loading of analytics charts and data
- Efficient bulk operation progress tracking

## Security Features
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive bulk operations
- Permission validation for all bulk actions
- Audit logging for bulk operations (backend handled)
- Rate limiting for search queries
- Secure bulk download with temporary URLs

## Accessibility Requirements
- Keyboard navigation for bulk selection (Space, Shift+Click)
- Screen reader support for multi-select states
- High contrast mode for charts and analytics
- Focus management for modal dialogs
- Clear labeling for all interactive elements

## Mobile Considerations
- Touch-friendly multi-select with long-press activation
- Swipe actions for individual documents
- Responsive search interface with collapsible filters
- Mobile-optimized analytics charts
- Bottom sheet modals for bulk actions

## Error Handling
- Partial failure handling for bulk operations with detailed results
- Search timeout and retry logic
- Analytics loading states and error recovery
- Network error handling with offline indicators
- Clear error messages with actionable solutions

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Multi-select functionality works across all document lists
- [ ] Bulk delete, share, and download operations function correctly
- [ ] Advanced search with filters returns accurate results
- [ ] Document analytics display usage data and charts
- [ ] All operations respect permission boundaries
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design tested on multiple devices
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Performance tested with large document sets (100+ documents)
- [ ] Error handling covers all failure scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests pass for all bulk operations

## Blockers/Dependencies
- Story 4.4 (Document Management Interface) - Must be completed
- Backend enhanced documents API - Available
- Backend permissions API - Available
- Chart library selection and setup

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time collaboration indicators
- Document templates and batch creation
- Advanced permission management UI
- Automated document organization rules
- Integration with external storage providers
- AI-powered document insights and recommendations

## Notes
- Consider implementing keyboard shortcuts for power users (Ctrl+A, Delete, etc.)
- Design should accommodate future real-time features
- Plan for internationalization in search and date formatting
- Consider implementing document preview in search results
- Chart library should be consistent with overall design system
