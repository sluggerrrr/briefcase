# Story 4.3: Document Upload Interface

**Epic:** User Interface & Document Management Dashboard
**Story Points:** 8
**Priority:** Must Have (P0)
**Sprint:** 4

## User Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** an intuitive document upload interface with security configuration options,  
**so that** I can easily upload and securely share documents with specified recipients and access controls.

## Description
Create a comprehensive document upload interface that allows users to upload files via drag-and-drop or file selection, configure security settings (expiration dates, view limits), select recipients, and track upload progress with proper error handling.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ⏳ Drag-and-drop file upload area with visual feedback and hover states
2. ⏳ File browser fallback for users who prefer traditional file selection
3. ⏳ File validation (type, size limits) with clear error messages
4. ⏳ File preview with metadata display (name, size, type) before upload
5. ⏳ Recipient selection with user search/autocomplete functionality
6. ⏳ Security settings configuration (expiration date, view limits)
7. ⏳ Document metadata form (title, description)
8. ⏳ Upload progress indicators with cancel capability
9. ⏳ Success/error handling with actionable feedback
10. ⏳ Integration with document dashboard (redirect after successful upload)

## Technical Requirements
- Next.js with TypeScript and App Router
- TanStack Form for form validation and state management
- TanStack Query for API integration and file upload
- shadcn/ui components for consistent design
- File handling with base64 encoding for backend compatibility
- Progress tracking during file upload
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Component Architecture
```
app/components/upload/
├── DocumentUpload.tsx          # Main upload container/page
├── FileDropZone.tsx           # Drag-and-drop upload area
├── FilePreview.tsx            # File preview with metadata
├── RecipientSelector.tsx      # User selection with search
├── SecuritySettings.tsx       # Expiration and view limit settings
├── DocumentMetadata.tsx       # Title and description form
├── UploadProgress.tsx         # Progress indicators
└── UploadSuccess.tsx          # Success state with actions

app/hooks/
├── useFileUpload.ts           # File upload logic and progress
├── useUserSearch.ts           # User search for recipient selection
└── useFileValidation.ts       # File validation utilities

app/lib/
└── upload-utils.ts            # File handling utilities
```

## UI Design Requirements
- **Drag & Drop Area**: Large, prominent upload zone with visual feedback
- **File Preview**: Thumbnail/icon with file details and remove option
- **Progressive Form**: Step-by-step or expandable sections for configuration
- **Recipient Search**: Autocomplete input with user suggestions
- **Security Controls**: Intuitive date picker and numeric inputs
- **Progress Feedback**: Clear progress bars and status messages
- **Mobile Optimized**: Touch-friendly interface with proper spacing

## File Upload Workflow
1. **File Selection**: User drops files or uses file picker
2. **Validation**: Check file type, size, and format requirements
3. **Preview**: Display file information and allow removal
4. **Configuration**: Set recipient, security settings, and metadata
5. **Upload**: Convert to base64 and send to backend with progress tracking
6. **Success**: Show confirmation and redirect to document dashboard

## Backend API Integration
Using existing document upload endpoint:

### Upload Endpoint
```typescript
POST /api/v1/documents
Content-Type: application/json

{
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  file_name: string;
  mime_type: string;
  content: string; // base64 encoded
  recipient_id: string;
  expires_at?: string; // ISO date
  view_limit?: number; // 1-10
}
```

### User Search Endpoint
```typescript
GET /api/v1/users?search={query}
// For recipient selection autocomplete
```

## File Validation Rules
- **File Size**: Maximum 10MB (enforced by backend)
- **File Types**: Documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX), Images (JPG, PNG, GIF), Archives (ZIP)
- **File Name**: Valid characters, reasonable length
- **Content**: Base64 encoding validation
- **Security**: Virus scanning integration (future enhancement)

## Form Validation
```typescript
interface UploadFormData {
  file: File;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  recipient_id: string;
  expires_at?: Date;
  view_limit?: number;
}

// Validation rules
- title: required, 1-255 characters
- recipient_id: required, valid user ID
- expires_at: optional, future date, max 1 year
- view_limit: optional, 1-10 views
- file: required, valid type/size
```

## Security Features
- **File Type Validation**: Whitelist of allowed MIME types
- **Size Limits**: Client and server-side enforcement
- **Content Scanning**: Base64 validation and future virus scanning
- **Access Controls**: Configurable expiration and view limits
- **Audit Trail**: Upload events logged automatically
- **Secure Transmission**: HTTPS with proper headers

## Progress and Feedback
- **Upload Progress**: Real-time progress bar with percentage
- **File Processing**: Visual feedback during base64 encoding
- **Error States**: Clear error messages with retry options
- **Success State**: Confirmation with link to uploaded document
- **Cancel Functionality**: Ability to abort upload in progress

## Responsive Design
- **Mobile (320px-768px)**: Stacked layout, touch-optimized controls
- **Tablet (768px-1024px)**: Compact form with collapsible sections
- **Desktop (1024px+)**: Full horizontal layout with side-by-side panels

## Accessibility Requirements
- WCAG AA compliance with proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader support for drag-and-drop areas
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Focus management for form progression

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of file preview components
- Debounced user search to reduce API calls
- File chunking for large uploads (future enhancement)
- Client-side file validation before API calls
- Optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance

## Error Handling
- **File Validation Errors**: Clear messages with suggested fixes
- **Network Errors**: Retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Server Errors**: User-friendly error messages
- **Upload Failures**: Option to retry or modify settings
- **Recipient Not Found**: Helpful suggestions for user search

## Integration Points
- Document Dashboard: Redirect after successful upload
- Authentication: Secure user context and permissions
- User Management: Recipient selection and validation
- Document Service: File upload and encryption

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Drag-and-drop upload area works across all browsers
- [ ] File validation prevents invalid uploads
- [ ] Recipient selection with search functionality works
- [ ] Security settings (expiration, view limits) apply correctly

- [ ] Error handling covers all failure scenarios
- [ ] Success state redirects to document dashboard
- [ ] Responsive design tested on mobile, tablet, desktop

- [ ] Integration tests pass for complete upload workflow

## Blockers/Dependencies
- Story 4.1 (Authentication UI) - Completed
- Story 4.2 (Document Dashboard) - Completed
- Backend document upload API - Available
- User listing API for recipient selection - Required

## Future Enhancements
- Multiple file upload with batch processing
- File drag-and-drop from external applications
- Advanced security settings (password protection)

- Integration with cloud storage providers
- Real-time collaboration features

## Notes
- Consider implementing chunked uploads for large files
- Plan for internationalization (i18n) in all text
- Design should accommodate future bulk upload features
- Consider keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Plan for offline upload queue (future PWA feature)
- Ensure upload area is prominent in dashboard layout
