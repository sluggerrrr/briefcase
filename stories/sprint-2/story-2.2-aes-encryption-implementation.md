# Story 2.2: AES Encryption Implementation and Key Management

**Epic:** Document Security & Storage System
**Story Points:** 8
**Priority:** Must Have (P0)
**Sprint:** 2

## User Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to implement robust AES-256 encryption for document content,  
**so that** all documents are securely encrypted at rest with proper key management.

## Description
Implement industry-standard AES-256 encryption for document content with secure key management, ensuring all documents are encrypted at rest and only accessible to authorized users.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ⏳ AES-256 encryption/decryption functions implemented using industry-standard libraries
2. ⏳ Secure encryption key generation and storage system established
3. ⏳ Document content encrypted before database storage with unique initialization vectors
4. ⏳ Decryption functionality restricted to authorized users (sender/recipient only)
5. ⏳ Encryption key rotation capability implemented with backward compatibility
6. ⏳ Comprehensive unit tests for encryption/decryption functionality covering edge cases
7. ⏳ Encryption performance benchmarking to ensure acceptable response times
8. ⏳ Secure key storage using environment variables or secure key management service

## Technical Requirements
- Python `cryptography` library with Fernet encryption
- Environment-based key management
- Unique initialization vectors per document
- Key rotation support
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive error handling

## Encryption Service Interface
```python
class EncryptionService:
    def encrypt_content(self, content: bytes) -> EncryptedContent:
        """Encrypt document content with AES-256"""
        
    def decrypt_content(self, encrypted_content: EncryptedContent, user_id: str, document_id: str) -> bytes:
        """Decrypt content for authorized users only"""
        
    def generate_key(self) -> str:
        """Generate new encryption key"""
        
    def rotate_key(self, old_key_id: str) -> str:
        """Rotate encryption key with backward compatibility"""

@dataclass
class EncryptedContent:
    data: str  # Base64 encoded encrypted content
    key_id: str  # Reference to encryption key
    iv: str  # Initialization vector
    algorithm: str  # Encryption algorithm used
```

## Security Requirements
- **AES-256 Encryption**: Industry standard encryption strength
- **Unique IVs**: Each document encrypted with unique initialization vector
- **Key Management**: Secure key storage and rotation capability
- **Access Control**: Decryption only for authorized users
- **Performance**: Sub-second encryption/decryption for typical documents

## Environment Configuration
```env
# Encryption Configuration
ENCRYPTION_KEY_PRIMARY=<base64-encoded-256-bit-key>
ENCRYPTION_KEY_SECONDARY=<base64-encoded-256-bit-key>  # For rotation
ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM=AES-256-GCM
KEY_ROTATION_INTERVAL_DAYS=90
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] AES-256 encryption implemented correctly
- [ ] Key generation and management working
- [ ] Unique IVs for each document
- [ ] Authorization checks for decryption
- [ ] Key rotation functionality
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements (<2s for 10MB files)
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests pass
- [ ] Security audit of encryption implementation

## Blockers/Dependencies
- Story 2.1 (Document Data Models and Metadata Management)

## Notes
- Use Fernet (AES-128) or AES-GCM for authenticated encryption
- Store keys securely outside of database
- Consider HSM integration for production
- Implement proper error handling for key rotation
- Document encryption key recovery procedures
