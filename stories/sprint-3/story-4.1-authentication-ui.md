# Story 4.1: Authentication UI and User Session Management

**Epic:** User Interface & Document Management Dashboard
**Story Points:** 5
**Priority:** Must Have (P0)
**Sprint:** 3

## User Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** a professional, secure login interface with session management,  
**so that** I can authenticate easily and maintain secure access to the document system.

## Description
Create a professional login interface with secure session management, protected routes, and proper authentication state handling using React and Next.js.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ⏳ Login page created with clean, professional design including email/password form
2. ⏳ JWT token storage and management implemented in frontend using secure HTTP-only cookies or localStorage
3. ⏳ Authentication state management using React Context or state management library
4. ⏳ Protected route handling redirecting unauthenticated users to login page
5. ⏳ Login error handling with user-friendly error messages and validation feedback
6. ⏳ Automatic redirect to dashboard after successful authentication with loading states
7. ⏳ Logout functionality with complete token cleanup and session termination
8. ⏳ "Remember me" functionality with extended session management
9. ⏳ Password strength validation and security best practices guidance

## Technical Requirements
- Next.js with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Hook Form for form validation
- React Context for authentication state
- Secure token storage strategy
- Protected route components

## Component Structure
```
src/components/auth/
├── LoginForm.tsx        # Main login form component
├── LogoutButton.tsx     # Logout functionality
└── ProtectedRoute.tsx   # Route protection wrapper

src/context/
└── AuthContext.tsx      # Authentication state management

src/pages/auth/
├── login.tsx           # Login page
└── register.tsx        # Registration page (future)

src/hooks/
└── useAuth.ts          # Authentication hook
```

## UI Design Requirements
- **Professional Design**: Clean, corporate styling with security focus
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance with proper ARIA labels
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during authentication
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **Security Indicators**: Visual cues for secure connection

## Authentication Flow
1. User enters credentials in login form
2. Form validation checks email format and password requirements
3. API call to backend authentication endpoint
4. Success: Store JWT token and redirect to dashboard
5. Error: Display user-friendly error message
6. Protected routes check authentication status
7. Logout clears token and redirects to login

## Security Features
- **Token Storage**: Secure storage with expiration handling
- **CSRF Protection**: Protection against cross-site request forgery
- **Input Validation**: Client-side validation with server-side verification
- **Session Management**: Automatic token refresh and logout
- **Route Protection**: Unauthorized access prevention

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Login form renders with proper styling
- [ ] Form validation works correctly
- [ ] Authentication API integration successful
- [ ] Token storage and retrieval working
- [ ] Protected routes redirect unauthorized users
- [ ] Logout functionality clears session
- [ ] Error handling displays user-friendly messages
- [ ] Responsive design works on all devices
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] All authentication UI tests pass

## Blockers/Dependencies
- Story 1.3 (JWT Authentication System Implementation)
- Story 1.4 (User Management and Test Data Seeding)

## Notes
- Use Next.js App Router for routing
- Implement proper loading states
- Consider using react-query for API state management
- Follow security best practices for token storage
- Plan for future social authentication integration
