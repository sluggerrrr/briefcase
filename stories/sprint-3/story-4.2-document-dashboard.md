# Story 4.2: Document Dashboard and Management Interface

**Epic:** User Interface & Document Management Dashboard
**Story Points:** 8
**Priority:** Must Have (P0)
**Sprint:** 3

## User Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** a comprehensive document dashboard to view, manage, and interact with my documents,  
**so that** I can efficiently organize and access my sent and received documents.

## Description
Create a comprehensive document management dashboard that allows users to view documents they've sent and received, search and filter documents, and perform actions like downloading, viewing details, and managing document settings.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ⏳ Document listing showing both sent and received documents with clear categorization
2. ⏳ Document cards/table view with essential information (title, recipient/sender, status, date)
3. ⏳ Search functionality to find documents by title, filename, or recipient/sender
4. ⏳ Filter options (sent/received, status, date range, file type)
5. ⏳ Document actions: view details, download, delete (for senders), copy link
6. ⏳ Document status indicators (active, expired, view limits exceeded)
7. ⏳ Responsive design working on desktop, tablet, and mobile
8. ⏳ Loading states and error handling for all operations
9. ⏳ Pagination or infinite scroll for large document lists
10. ⏳ Document statistics (total documents, storage used, access counts)

## Technical Requirements
- Next.js with TypeScript and App Router
- TanStack Query for API state management
- shadcn/ui components for consistent design
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Integration with existing authentication system
- Error boundaries and loading states

## Component Architecture
```
app/components/dashboard/
├── DocumentDashboard.tsx        # Main dashboard layout
├── DocumentList.tsx             # Document listing component
├── DocumentCard.tsx             # Individual document card
├── DocumentTable.tsx            # Table view alternative
├── DocumentActions.tsx          # Action buttons (download, delete, etc.)
├── DocumentFilters.tsx          # Search and filter controls
├── DocumentStats.tsx            # Statistics cards
├── DocumentUploadArea.tsx       # Upload interface (future story)
└── DocumentDetails.tsx          # Document detail modal/page

app/hooks/
├── useDocuments.ts              # Document listing hook
├── useDocumentActions.ts        # Document operations hook
└── useDocumentFilters.ts        # Search and filter hook
```

## UI Design Requirements
- **Card/Grid View**: Visual document cards with thumbnails and key info
- **Table View**: Detailed table with sortable columns for power users
- **Search Bar**: Prominent search with real-time filtering
- **Filter Sidebar**: Collapsible filters for status, date, type, etc.
- **Action Buttons**: Clear, accessible action buttons with icons
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded status badges (active, expired, etc.)
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no documents found
- **Mobile-First**: Touch-friendly interface on mobile devices

## Backend API Integration
Based on existing backend endpoints:

### Document Operations
```typescript
// Get user documents
GET /api/v1/documents?sent=true&received=true

// Get specific document info
GET /api/v1/documents/{id}

// Download document
GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/download

// Delete document (sender only)
DELETE /api/v1/documents/{id}

// Update document metadata (sender only)
PUT /api/v1/documents/{id}
```

### Data Types
```typescript
interface DocumentResponse {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  file_name: string;
  file_size: number;
  mime_type: string;
  sender_email: string;
  recipient_email: string;
  status: 'active' | 'expired' | 'deleted';
  created_at: string;
  expires_at?: string;
  view_limit?: number;
  access_count: number;
}
```

## Features by View

### Document List View
- **Sent Documents**: Documents uploaded by the user
- **Received Documents**: Documents assigned to the user
- **All Documents**: Combined view with clear sender/recipient indicators
- **Search**: Real-time search across title, filename, sender/recipient
- **Sort**: By date, title, status, file size

### Document Actions
- **View Details**: Modal with full document information and access logs
- **Download**: Secure download with decryption
- **Delete**: Soft delete for senders with confirmation
- **Copy Link**: Share document access link (for senders)
- **Update Settings**: Modify expiration, view limits (for senders)

### Filtering Options
- **Document Type**: By status (active, expired, deleted)
- **Date Range**: Created/modified date filters
- **File Type**: By MIME type categories
- **Sender/Recipient**: Filter by specific users
- **Access Status**: Never accessed, accessed, expired

## Responsive Design Breakpoints
- **Mobile (320px-768px)**: Card view, collapsible filters, touch-optimized
- **Tablet (768px-1024px)**: Card grid, sidebar filters
- **Desktop (1024px+)**: Table view option, full feature set

## Performance Considerations
- Virtual scrolling for large document lists
- Optimistic updates for quick feedback
- Debounced search to reduce API calls
- Cached document metadata with TanStack Query
- Image thumbnails lazy loading

## Accessibility Requirements
- WCAG AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation for all actions
- Screen reader friendly with proper ARIA labels
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management for modals and dropdowns

## Error Handling
- **Network Errors**: Retry logic with user feedback
- **Authentication Errors**: Redirect to login
- **Authorization Errors**: Clear access denied messages
- **Document Not Found**: Helpful error with suggestions
- **Server Errors**: Generic error with retry option

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Document listing displays sent and received documents
- [ ] Search functionality works across all document fields
- [ ] Filter options work correctly and persist user preferences
- [ ] Document actions (download, delete, view) function properly
- [ ] Responsive design tested on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [ ] Loading states provide clear feedback
- [ ] Error handling covers all failure scenarios
- [ ] Performance tested with large document lists
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Integration tests pass for all document operations

## Blockers/Dependencies
- Story 4.1 (Authentication UI) - Completed
- Story 3.1 (Secure Document Viewing) - Backend complete
- Story 3.2 (Access Tracking & Audit) - Backend complete

## Future Enhancements
- Bulk operations (delete multiple, download as zip)
- Advanced search with filters
- Document sharing and collaboration
- Document version history
- Automated document organization
- Integration with cloud storage providers

## Notes
- Consider implementing virtual scrolling for performance with large lists
- Plan for internationalization (i18n) in text and date formatting
- Design should accommodate future document upload interface
- Consider implementing keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Plan for real-time updates when documents are accessed by recipients
