## User Story
**As a** user managing documents in Briefcase,  
**I want** improved document card design with better visual hierarchy and information display,  
**so that** I can quickly scan, understand, and interact with my documents efficiently across all devices.

## Description
Enhance the document card interface based on real-user testing with Playwright MCP using Alice's test account. Focus on fixing information truncation, improving visual hierarchy, and optimizing the mobile experience while maintaining excellent theme support.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. ☐ Improve document title prominence in card hierarchy
3. ☐ Add better text overflow handling with tooltips for long content
4. ☐ Enhance visual separation between card sections
5. ☐ Optimize card density and spacing for better readability

### Medium Priority - UX Enhancements  
6. ☐ Replace emoji file icons with consistent Lucide React icons
7. ☐ Improve status badge positioning and visual integration
8. ☐ Add hover states and loading indicators for card actions
9. ☐ Enhance mobile touch targets for dropdown actions
10. ☐ Implement better focus indicators for keyboard navigation

### Theme & Responsive Optimizations
11. ☐ Verify color contrast compliance in both light and dark themes
12. ☐ Optimize single-column mobile layout for cards
13. ☐ Add smooth transitions for theme switching
14. ☐ Ensure consistent rendering across different screen sizes

## Technical Requirements

- Improved metadata grouping and visual organization
- Better truncation strategies with progressive disclosure
- Consistent icon system integration

### Information Display
- Full email addresses with smart truncation
- Clearer file size and date formatting
- Status indicators that don't compete with actions
- Description text that integrates naturally

### Interactive Elements
- Larger touch targets for mobile (minimum 44x44px)
- Improved dropdown menu accessibility
- Better hover and focus states
- Loading states for actions

### Responsive Behavior
- Optimized card layout for 375px mobile viewport
- Proper adaptation for desktop (1920px) and tablet sizes

## Testing Insights (From Playwright MCP Analysis)

### Current State Assessment
- ✅ Theme switching works well (light → dark transition tested)
- ✅ Mobile responsive layout adapts properly
- ✅ Status badge system functions correctly
- ✅ Action dropdown menus work as expected

### Identified Issues
- ❌ "Sender:" label shows but email is hidden
- ❌ File names get truncated without hover info
- ❌ Information feels cramped and hard to scan
- ❌ Emoji icons may render inconsistently across systems

### User Experience Observations
Using Alice's account with 3 documents:
- Image file (214.7 KB, Active status, 0/10 views)
- Text file (417.4 KB, View limit reached, 3/3 views)  
- Test document (287 B, Active, with description)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Information Display Fixes
1. Fix email truncation - show full sender/recipient emails
2. Add tooltip hover states for truncated content
3. Improve file name display with better overflow handling
4. Enhance visual hierarchy with typography improvements

### Phase 2: Visual Design Enhancements
1. Replace emoji icons with Lucide React icons
2. Redesign status badge positioning and styling
3. Improve card spacing and visual separation
4. Add proper hover and focus states

### Phase 3: Mobile & Interaction Optimization
1. Optimize touch targets for mobile interactions
2. Enhance single-column mobile layout
3. Add smooth loading states for actions
4. Improve keyboard navigation experience

## Design Requirements

### Visual Hierarchy
- Prominent document titles (larger font, better contrast)
- Secondary information clearly grouped
- Status and metadata visually distinct but harmonious
- Action buttons easily discoverable but not overwhelming

### Information Architecture
- Primary info: Title, file icon, status
- Secondary info: Size, dates, view counts
- Tertiary info: Description, extended metadata
- Actions: Edit, share, download, delete (context-appropriate)

### Responsive Design
- Desktop: Multi-column grid with full information
- Tablet: 2-column layout with smart truncation
- Mobile: Single column with essential info prioritized

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient re-rendering for theme changes
- Optimized hover state performance
- Lazy loading for large document lists
- Smooth animations that respect user preferences

## Accessibility Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for color contrast
- Proper ARIA labels for all card elements
- Keyboard navigation through card actions
- Screen reader friendly metadata structure
- Focus indicators that work in both themes

## Testing Strategy
- Playwright MCP testing with real user accounts
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile device testing (iOS/Android)
- Theme switching validation
- Keyboard navigation verification
- Screen reader compatibility testing

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Sender/recipient emails display correctly and completely
- [ ] Document titles are visually prominent in card hierarchy
- [ ] Text truncation includes hover tooltips for full content
- [ ] File type icons use consistent Lucide React iconography
- [ ] Status badges integrate well with overall card design
- [ ] Mobile touch targets meet 44x44px minimum requirement
- [ ] Hover and focus states provide clear visual feedback
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards in both themes
- [ ] Smooth theme transition animations implemented
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works flawlessly through all cards
- [ ] Card density optimized for scanning and readability

## Notes
- Analysis based on real user testing with Alice's account (alice@briefcase.com)
- Screenshots captured: empty state, mobile (375px), desktop (1920px), light theme, dark theme
- Three document types tested: image file, text file with limits, test document with description
- Current implementation already has good foundation - focusing on polish and usability improvements
