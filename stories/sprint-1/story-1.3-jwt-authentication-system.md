# Story 1.3: JWT Authentication System Implementation

**Epic:** Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure
**Story Points:** 5
**Priority:** Must Have (P0)
**Sprint:** 1

## User Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** to authenticate securely using email and password credentials,  
**so that** I can access the document delivery system with proper authorization.

## Description
Implement complete JWT-based authentication system including user login, token generation/validation, password hashing, and authentication middleware for securing API endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ⏳ JWT token generation and validation implemented in FastAPI with configurable expiration
2. ⏳ Password hashing implemented using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
3. ⏳ User login endpoint created (`POST /api/auth/login`) with email/password validation
4. ⏳ JWT token refresh mechanism implemented to extend session without re-authentication
5. ⏳ Authentication middleware created to protect secured endpoints and validate tokens
6. ⏳ User logout functionality implemented that handles token invalidation
7. ⏳ Secure token storage strategy documented for frontend implementation
8. ⏳ Authentication error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes and messages

## Technical Requirements
- PyJWT for token handling
- bcrypt for password hashing
- FastAPI security utilities
- Configurable token expiration
- Secure secret key management
- Proper error handling and status codes

## API Endpoints
```
POST /api/auth/login
- Input: {"email": "user@example.com", "password": "password"}
- Output: {"access_token": "jwt_token", "token_type": "bearer", "user": {...}}

POST /api/auth/refresh
- Input: Authorization header with valid JWT
- Output: {"access_token": "new_jwt_token", "token_type": "bearer"}

POST /api/auth/logout
- Input: Authorization header with valid JWT
- Output: {"message": "Successfully logged out"}
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Login endpoint authenticates users successfully
- [ ] JWT tokens generated with proper expiration
- [ ] Password hashing works securely
- [ ] Authentication middleware protects endpoints
- [ ] Token refresh functionality works
- [ ] Logout invalidates tokens
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] All authentication tests pass

## Blockers/Dependencies
- Story 1.2 (Database Setup and User Data Models)

## Notes
- Use environment variables for JWT secrets
- Implement rate limiting for login attempts
- Follow OWASP authentication best practices
- Document token storage strategy for frontend
