# Story 1.1: Project Infrastructure Setup

**Epic:** Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure
**Story Points:** 5
**Priority:** Must Have (P0)
**Sprint:** 1

## User Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to establish the Next.js + FastAPI monorepo project structure,  
**so that** we have a solid, organized foundation for secure application development.

## Description
Set up the basic project infrastructure including backend FastAPI application structure, database setup, and development environment configuration to enable development of the secure document delivery system.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Monorepo structure created with separate `apps/frontend/` and `apps/backend/` directories
2. ✅ Next.js application initialized with TypeScript configuration and essential dependencies
3. ⏳ FastAPI application initialized with Python virtual environment and project structure
4. ⏳ Development environment configuration with package management (uv for backend, npm for frontend)
5. ⏳ Basic project documentation in CLAUDE.md files
6. ⏳ Git repository with appropriate .gitignore files for both Node.js and Python
7. ⏳ Environment variable templates (.env.example files)

## Technical Requirements
- FastAPI backend with uv package manager
- Next.js frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- PostgreSQL database configuration
- Environment variable management
- Proper .gitignore files

## Definition of Done
- [ ] FastAPI app runs successfully with `uv run` command
- [ ] Next.js app runs successfully with `npm run dev`
- [ ] Database connection established
- [ ] All .gitignore files properly exclude sensitive/build files
- [ ] Environment templates created
- [ ] README documentation updated

## Blockers/Dependencies
- None (foundational story)

## Notes
- Frontend already partially complete
- Focus on backend FastAPI setup and database configuration
- Ensure security best practices from the start
