# Story 1.2: Database Setup and User Data Models

**Epic:** Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure
**Story Points:** 3
**Priority:** Must Have (P0)
**Sprint:** 1

## User Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to establish database connectivity and create user data models,  
**so that** we can securely store user information and authentication credentials.

## Description
Create the database schema and SQLAlchemy models for user management, including proper indexing, constraints, and migration system setup.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Database connection established using SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL
2. ✅ User model created with fields: id, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at, is_active
3. ✅ Database migration system implemented using Alembic for schema version control
4. ✅ User table created with proper indexes on email field and unique constraints
5. ✅ Database connection pooling and error handling implemented
6. ✅ Database schema documentation generated and maintained
7. ✅ Database seeding infrastructure prepared for test user creation

## Technical Requirements
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 with async support
- Alembic for database migrations
- PostgreSQL with proper indexes
- UUID primary keys for security
- Proper foreign key constraints
- Timestamps with timezone support

## Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);

CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] User model runs without errors
- [ ] Alembic migrations work correctly
- [ ] Database connection established
- [ ] All constraints and indexes created
- [ ] Connection pooling configured
- [ ] Error handling implemented

## Blockers/Dependencies
- Story 1.1 (Project Infrastructure Setup)
- PostgreSQL database available

## Notes
- Use UUID for user IDs for security
- Implement proper database connection handling
- Prepare for test user seeding in next story
