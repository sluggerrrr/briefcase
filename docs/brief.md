# Project Brief: Secure Internal Document Delivery System

## Executive Summary

A secure internal document delivery tool that enables employees to share encrypted, access-controlled documents such as contracts and reports. The system provides JWT-based authentication, AES encryption at rest, configurable view limits and expiration dates, and automatic cleanup for enhanced security. Built with Next.js frontend and Python FastAPI backend in a monorepo structure.

## Problem Statement

Organizations currently lack a secure, controlled method for sharing sensitive internal documents between employees. Existing solutions may not provide adequate encryption, access controls, or automatic document lifecycle management. This creates security risks where sensitive documents like contracts and reports could be accessed by unauthorized personnel, remain available longer than intended, or lack proper audit trails. The absence of view limitations and expiration controls means documents can be accessed indefinitely, increasing exposure risk and potential compliance issues.

## Proposed Solution

A web-based secure document delivery system that encrypts documents at rest using AES encryption and enforces strict access controls. The solution features user authentication via JWT tokens, document assignment to specific recipients, configurable view limits and expiration dates, and automatic deletion when security rules are triggered. The system maintains an audit trail of all access attempts and provides a minimal, intuitive interface for document upload, management, and retrieval operations.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: Internal Employees
- **Demographics**: Corporate employees across all departments requiring secure document sharing
- **Current behaviors**: Using email attachments, shared drives, or unsecured messaging for document sharing
- **Specific needs**: Secure document transmission with controlled access and time-limited availability
- **Pain points**: Lack of encryption, no access controls, documents remaining accessible indefinitely
- **Goals**: Share sensitive documents securely with confidence that access is controlled and monitored

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Business Objectives
- Enhance document security through encryption and access controls
- Reduce security risks from unauthorized document access
- Implement automated compliance through expiration and view limits
- Provide audit trails for document access activities
- Streamline secure document sharing workflows

### User Success Metrics
- Time to upload and assign documents < 2 minutes
- Document access success rate > 99% for authorized users
- Zero unauthorized access incidents
- User adoption rate > 80% within first quarter

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Document Security**: 100% of documents encrypted at rest
- **Access Control**: 100% enforcement of sender/recipient-only access
- **Automated Cleanup**: 100% compliance with expiration and view limit rules
- **User Experience**: Average task completion time under 2 minutes
- **System Reliability**: 99.5% uptime for document access operations

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)
- **User Authentication**: JWT-based login with email/password, seeded with 2-3 test users
- **Document Upload**: Base64/text document upload with recipient assignment
- **Access Controls**: View limits and expiration date configuration per document
- **Document Security**: AES encryption at rest with automatic deletion triggers
- **Document Access**: Secure view/download functionality with access tracking
- **User Interface**: Minimal web interface showing uploaded and received documents

### Out of Scope for MVP
- Mobile applications
- Advanced user management (roles, groups, permissions)
- Document versioning or collaboration features
- Integration with external systems
- Advanced analytics or reporting
- Bulk document operations
- Document preview or editing capabilities

### MVP Success Criteria
System demonstrates secure document sharing between test users with all security features functional, including encryption, access controls, and automated cleanup.

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features
- Advanced user management with role-based permissions
- Document collaboration and annotation features
- Mobile application for document access
- Integration with existing corporate systems

### Long-term Vision
Evolution into a comprehensive secure document management platform with advanced workflow automation, enterprise-grade compliance features, and integration capabilities for organizational document lifecycle management.

### Expansion Opportunities
- Multi-tenant capability for different departments
- Advanced analytics and compliance reporting
- API integrations with document management systems
- Workflow automation for document approval processes

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements
- **Target Platforms**: Web responsive (desktop primary, mobile compatible)
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with JavaScript enabled
- **Performance Requirements**: Sub-2 second response times for document operations

### Technology Preferences
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript for optimal performance and developer experience
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI for high-performance async API development
- **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production scalability
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens for stateless security architecture

### Architecture Considerations
- **Repository Structure**: Monorepo containing both frontend and backend applications
- **Service Architecture**: Monolithic application for simplicity and security
- **Integration Requirements**: Self-contained system with minimal external dependencies
- **Security/Compliance**: AES encryption, audit logging, automated data lifecycle management

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- **Budget**: Internal development project with existing team resources
- **Timeline**: MVP delivery target within 8-12 weeks
- **Resources**: 2-3 developers with full-stack capabilities
- **Technical**: Must use specified Next.js + FastAPI technology stack

### Key Assumptions
- Users have basic web application familiarity
- Corporate network provides adequate security infrastructure
- Document sizes will remain within reasonable limits for base64 encoding
- Test users sufficient for initial validation and demonstration

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
- **Encryption Implementation**: Ensuring proper AES encryption implementation without security vulnerabilities
- **Key Management**: Secure storage and rotation of encryption keys
- **Performance Impact**: Base64 encoding efficiency for larger documents
- **Cleanup Reliability**: Ensuring automated deletion processes function correctly

### Open Questions
- What is the maximum expected document size for base64 encoding?
- Are there specific compliance requirements (SOC2, ISO27001) to consider?
- Should the system integrate with existing corporate authentication (SSO)?
- What backup and disaster recovery requirements exist for encrypted documents?

### Areas Needing Further Research
- Corporate security policy alignment and approval requirements
- Performance benchmarking for encryption/decryption operations with expected document volumes
- User experience testing for document upload and access workflows
