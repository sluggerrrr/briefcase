# Secure Internal Document Delivery System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable secure document sharing between internal employees with encrypted, access-controlled delivery
- Implement automated document lifecycle management with view limits and expiration controls
- Provide minimal, intuitive web interface for document upload, assignment, and retrieval operations
- Ensure 100% enforcement of sender/recipient-only access with comprehensive audit trails
- Deliver MVP demonstrating secure document sharing with all security features functional

### Background Context
Organizations currently lack secure, controlled methods for sharing sensitive internal documents between employees. Existing solutions may not provide adequate encryption, access controls, or automatic document lifecycle management, creating security risks where sensitive documents like contracts and reports could be accessed by unauthorized personnel or remain available longer than intended. This secure document delivery system addresses these gaps by providing AES encryption at rest, strict access controls, configurable expiration policies, and automated cleanup to minimize data exposure risks while maintaining usability for internal document sharing workflows.
