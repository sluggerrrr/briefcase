# Epic 2: Document Security & Storage System

**Epic Goal**: Create secure document upload functionality with AES encryption, implement secure storage with recipient assignment capabilities, and establish configurable security parameters including view limits and expiration dates.

### Story 2.1: Document Data Models and Metadata Management
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to create comprehensive document data models and metadata management,  
**so that** we can track document lifecycle, ownership, and access controls effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Document model created with fields: id, title, sender_id, recipient_id, created_at, expires_at, view_limit, access_count, status, encrypted_content
2. Document-to-User relationship models established with proper foreign key constraints
3. Document status enumeration implemented (active, expired, view_exhausted, deleted)
4. Database migrations created for document schema with proper indexes
5. Document metadata CRUD operations implemented with authorization checks
6. Document ownership validation ensuring only sender can modify metadata
7. Document status calculation logic based on expiration date and view count

### Story 2.2: AES Encryption Implementation and Key Management
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to implement robust AES-256 encryption for document content,  
**so that** all documents are securely encrypted at rest with proper key management.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. AES-256 encryption/decryption functions implemented using industry-standard libraries
2. Secure encryption key generation and storage system established
3. Document content encrypted before database storage with unique initialization vectors
4. Decryption functionality restricted to authorized users (sender/recipient only)
5. Encryption key rotation capability implemented with backward compatibility
6. Comprehensive unit tests for encryption/decryption functionality covering edge cases
7. Encryption performance benchmarking to ensure acceptable response times
8. Secure key storage using environment variables or secure key management service

### Story 2.3: Document Upload and Recipient Assignment
**As a** user,  
**I want** to upload documents and assign them to specific recipients with security parameters,  
**so that** I can securely share sensitive documents with controlled access.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Document upload endpoint created (`POST /api/documents/upload`) with multipart form support
2. Base64 file content encoding and validation implemented for development purposes
3. Recipient selection from authenticated user list with validation
4. Optional view limit configuration (1-10 views) with default values
5. Optional expiration date setting with validation (future dates only, maximum 1 year)
6. File type validation and reasonable size limits (e.g., 10MB max for base64)
7. Document title and description metadata capture
8. Comprehensive upload success/error responses with detailed feedback
9. Upload progress tracking and error recovery mechanisms

### Story 2.4: Access Control and Security Rule Enforcement
**As a** system,  
**I want** to implement strict access control and security rule enforcement,  
**so that** only authorized users can access documents and security policies are automatically enforced.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Document access validation middleware ensuring sender/recipient-only access
2. Authorization checks integrated into all document-related endpoints
3. Document permission verification before any view, download, or metadata operation
4. Comprehensive security audit logging for all document access attempts (successful and failed)
5. Unauthorized access prevention with detailed logging and alerting
6. Document ownership and recipient validation with clear error messages
7. Security rule enforcement including view count limits and expiration date checks
8. Automated security compliance checking and reporting
