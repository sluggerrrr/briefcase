# Epic 3: Document Access Control & Lifecycle Management

**Epic Goal**: Enable secure document viewing and downloading for authorized users, implement comprehensive access tracking with audit trails, and establish automated document lifecycle management based on security rules and expiration policies.

### Story 3.1: Secure Document Viewing and Download
**As a** recipient,  
**I want** to securely view and download documents assigned to me,  
**so that** I can access shared information while maintaining security and access tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Document retrieval endpoint (`GET /api/documents/{id}/view`) with authorization validation
2. Document download endpoint (`GET /api/documents/{id}/download`) with secure file serving
3. Document content decryption for authorized users only (sender and recipient)
4. Automatic access count increment on each successful view operation
5. Secure HTTP headers for file download (Content-Disposition, Content-Type, etc.)
6. Document content served with appropriate MIME types and security headers
7. Access attempt validation with clear error messages for unauthorized users
8. Download functionality preserving original filename and format

### Story 3.2: Comprehensive Access Tracking and Audit Trail
**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** to maintain detailed access tracking and audit trails for all document operations,  
**so that** we have complete visibility into document usage and security compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Document access tracking table and model created with timestamp, user, action, and result fields
2. Every document access attempt logged (view, download, metadata access) with detailed context
3. Failed access attempts logged with reason codes and user information
4. View count tracking and real-time updates with concurrent access handling
5. Access history retrieval endpoint (`GET /api/documents/{id}/access-history`) for document owners
6. Comprehensive audit trail reporting with filtering and export capabilities
7. Performance optimization for audit logging to prevent system slowdown
8. Data retention policies for audit logs with automated cleanup

### Story 3.3: Automated Document Lifecycle Management
**As a** system,  
**I want** to automatically manage document expiration and deletion based on security rules,  
**so that** security policies are enforced without manual intervention and data exposure is minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Scheduled background job system implemented for automated cleanup tasks
2. Document expiration checking based on expires_at timestamps with timezone handling
3. View limit enforcement with automatic document deactivation when limits reached
4. Secure document deletion ensuring complete data removal from storage and database
5. Cleanup job execution logging with success/failure tracking and error handling
6. Grace period handling with notification system for upcoming expirations
7. Document status updates reflecting lifecycle changes (active → expired → deleted)
8. Cleanup job monitoring and alerting for system administrators

### Story 3.4: Document Status and Metadata API
**As a** user,  
**I want** to access document status and metadata information,  
**so that** I understand document availability, access limitations, and remaining usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Dynamic document status calculation (active, expired, view-exhausted, deleted)
2. Document metadata endpoint (`GET /api/documents/{id}/metadata`) returning comprehensive information
3. Remaining views calculation and display with real-time updates
4. Expiration status and time remaining calculations with user-friendly formatting
5. Document access history summary for document owners and recipients
6. Status indicators optimized for UI consumption with clear categorization
7. Metadata caching for performance optimization with cache invalidation
8. Document summary endpoint (`GET /api/documents/summary`) for dashboard display
