# Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure

**Epic Goal**: Establish secure project foundation with Next.js + FastAPI monorepo setup, implement JWT authentication system, and create user management functionality with seeded test users for development and demonstration purposes.

### Story 1.1: Project Infrastructure Setup
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to establish the Next.js + FastAPI monorepo project structure,  
**so that** we have a solid, organized foundation for secure application development.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo structure created with separate `frontend/` and `backend/` directories
2. Next.js application initialized with TypeScript configuration and essential dependencies
3. FastAPI application initialized with Python virtual environment and project structure
4. Development environment configuration with package management (npm/yarn for frontend, pip/poetry for backend)
5. Docker configuration files created for both frontend and backend applications
6. Root-level README with comprehensive setup and development instructions
7. Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore files for both Node.js and Python
8. Basic CI/CD pipeline configuration for automated testing and deployment

### Story 1.2: Database Setup and User Data Models
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to establish database connectivity and create user data models,  
**so that** we can securely store user information and authentication credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Database connection established using SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite for development
2. User model created with fields: id, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at, is_active
3. Database migration system implemented using Alembic for schema version control
4. User table created with proper indexes on email field and unique constraints
5. Database connection pooling and error handling implemented
6. Database schema documentation generated and maintained
7. Database seeding infrastructure prepared for test user creation

### Story 1.3: JWT Authentication System Implementation
**As a** user,  
**I want** to authenticate securely using email and password credentials,  
**so that** I can access the document delivery system with proper authorization.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. JWT token generation and validation implemented in FastAPI with configurable expiration
2. Password hashing implemented using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
3. User login endpoint created (`POST /api/auth/login`) with email/password validation
4. JWT token refresh mechanism implemented to extend session without re-authentication
5. Authentication middleware created to protect secured endpoints and validate tokens
6. User logout functionality implemented that handles token invalidation
7. Secure token storage strategy documented for frontend implementation
8. Authentication error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes and messages

### Story 1.4: User Management and Test Data Seeding
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to implement user registration functionality and seed test users,  
**so that** we have authenticated users available for document sharing operations testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. User registration endpoint created (`POST /api/auth/register`) with input validation
2. Email format validation and duplicate email prevention implemented
3. Database seeding script created with 2-3 test users (different roles/departments for testing)
4. User profile retrieval endpoint implemented (`GET /api/users/me`) for authenticated users
5. Basic user listing endpoint (`GET /api/users`) for recipient selection functionality
6. User password update functionality with current password verification
7. Account status management (active/inactive) with appropriate access controls
